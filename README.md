## Key Benefits:
- Built for enterprise with security, reliability, and scalability
- End to end integration from data access (ADLS, SQL DW, EventHub, Kafka, etc.), data prep, feature engineering, model building in single node or distributed, MLops with MLflow, integration with AzureML, Synapse, & other Azure services.
- Delta Lake to set the data foundation with higher data quality, reliability and performance for downstream ML & AI use cases 
- ML Runtime Optimizations
    - Reliable and secure distribution of open source ML frameworks
    - Packages and optimizes most common ML frameworks
    - Built-in optimization for distributed deep learning
    - Built-in AutoML and Experiment tracking
    - Customized environments using conda for reproducibility
- Distributed Machine Learning
    - Spark MLlib
    - Migrate Single Node to distributed with just a few lines of code changes:
        - Distributed hyperparameter search (Hyperopt, Gridsearch)
        - PandasUDF to distribute models over different subsets of data or hyperparameters
        - Koalas: Pandas DataFrame API on Spark
    - Distributed Deep Learning training with Horovod
- Use your own tools
    - Multiple languages in same Databricks notebooks (Python, R, Scala, SQL)
    - Databricks Connect: connect external tools with Azure databricks (IDEs, RStudio, Jupyter,...)
